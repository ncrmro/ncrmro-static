# Why

## Move away from Django
Django has really become heavy laden with concepts that don't really work well with a purly API. 
Some examples is when creating a REST or GraphQL endpoint you can end using the Forms API.

Not typed although things like Python type hints and Fast api use these.
In Rust typing is strictly enforced.
With Open API we can generate javascript/typescript api clients automatically

 
## Embeded 

I've been wanting to get into fields like Robotics and SCADA. Eg writing code that affects the real world.
