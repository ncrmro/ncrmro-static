Hello World

## Think in percent and now dollars

## Learn to quickly calcualte percents quickly

## Have zero emotional attachment to the company

## Don't follow the news

## Dont Catch faling Knives

## Exiting and Reitnerintg Falling Positions

If you where previously up and are a few percents down best to close out the
majority of your position and eat any loss. Then go ahead and set a trailing
stop buy to get in on a better position. Best to look at say a month ago as well
and that will tell you where your stop buy should be set

This is almost always perferable to double downing as selling it will give you
the capital to fund the next order.

## Shuffling your Porfolio

Sometimes its best not to set trailing stop losses, say your up 3 percent.
Sometimes its best to sell a portion of that asset to cover orders for other
assets that may be down.
